Hi, I'm Mubashir - an Exprienced Frontend Developer aspiring to grow into a proficient, reliable Full Stack resource.
Ever since starting my career in mid 2019, I have mostly been writing HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeSycript, RxJS in Angular, React. These days, my work helps Pakistan eliminate the Polio Virus.
