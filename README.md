I convert ideas and designs into human-centric web applications and developer-centric code - and I have been doing so for the last 5 years. I have extensive experience building Modern Web Applications & Experiences, Responsive Layouts, Human-Centric UIs and Developer-centric Codebases using NextJS, React, Tailwind, Angular 2+. I also hold hands-on knowledge and experience of building NodeJS-powered backends. I am also the writer behind the code blog  of UnUsedCSS - a CSS minifIer based out of London.
I'm also the writer behind UnusedCSS's Frontend [Blog](https://unused-css.com/blog/).
